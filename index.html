	<p> I learned the proper approach to creating polished videos with limited crew and quick turnaround times.<br> I wrote, directed and filmed a one minute public service announcement and a five documentary.<br> I have worked with a film crew to produce five minute narrative film that I wrote and directed. I have completed a Bachelors Degree in Communication Arts: Radio, Television, and Film, and acertificate in <b>Digital Studies</b> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<br> I am letter-winning coxswain for Wisconsin Menâ€™s Rowing, I has raced in three IRA National Championships. I have been able to balance 20 hrs/week of practice along with a full class load. <br> I plan to continue my love of film to become a producer to help people create the content they want to share with the world </p>
